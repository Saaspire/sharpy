Sharpy
======

Sharpy is a client for the Cheddar Getter (https://cheddargetter.com/) API.
Cheddar Getter is a great service for handling recurring and usage based
billing.

There are some existing python Cheddar Getter clients but they have
significant licensing problems, packaging problems, bugs, and are only partial
implementations of the Cheddar Getter API.

Sharpy offers a number of advantages:

* Clear and simple BSD license.
* Both a high and low level API - Work with cheddar the way you want to.
* 100% test coverage.
* Proper packaging - Sharpy can be installed via easy_install and PIP.
* Will have complete documentation soon.
* Supports most of the Cheddar and will the full Cheddar Getter API soon.
